## My process

- I kept my workflow as simple as possible (from top to bottom). Starting with the background color, I then opened a container where my elements where going to go in. After sizing my container roughly, I inserted my image(s) and sized as close to optimal as i could. From there, my text needed some slight modifiations such as spacing, font-family and color. Ive changed them to match and added spacing. With all my content in place, I adjusted some more sizing to taste.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
  <-- Importing google fonts 2 steps-->
  @font-face {
    font-family: Outfit;
    src: url(https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit);
}
.container {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    display: grid;
    width: 350px;
    height: 550px;
    margin: auto;
    border-radius: 20px;
    text-align: center;
    margin-top: 10em;
}
