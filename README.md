## My process

- I kept my workflow as simple as possible (from top to bottom). Starting with the background color, I then opened a container where my elements where going to go in. After sizing my container roughly, I inserted my image(s) and sized as close to optimal as i could. From there, my text needed some slight modifiations such as spacing, font-family and color. Ive changed them to match and added spacing. With all my content in place, I adjusted some more sizing to taste.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
